(a).

The graph does not  have a negative cycle.

Bellman-Ford algorithm allows us to check whether there exists a cycle of negative weight in the graph.
Do N iterations of Bellman-Ford algorithm. If there were no changes on the last iteration, there is no cycle of negative weight in the graph.
Othotherwise take a vertex the distance to which has changed, 
and go from it via its ancestors until a cycle is found.
This cycle will be the desired cycle of negative weight.

(b).

 Bellman Ford algorithm i will use to find the single source all pair shortest path.
 the graph have negative edges.With negative edges only  Bellman Ford algorithm  can
 find  the single source all pair shortest path which Dijkstra Algorithm and  Floyd-Warshall
 can't.that's why  I will use  Bellman Ford algorithm  to find the single source all pair shortest path.


(c).

let's consider the source is 0.

Vertex  Distance from Source Vertex is:
vertex          distance 
0                0
1                5
2                2
3                8
