a.

In graph 1  Dijkstra Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall and Bellman Ford
three of them can be applied.

but In graph 2 only Bellman Ford can be applied because  Dijkstra Algorithm and Floyd-Warshall
doesn't work in negative edges.

b.
In graph 1 we can apply Dijkstra Algorithm.
let consider the source node is 1 than the shortest
path from 1 to all of the node is :

1 to 2 is 3
1 to 3 is 4
1 to 4 is 3
1 to 5 is 5

In graph 2 only Bellman Ford can be applied.
let consider the source node is 0 than,

Vertex Distance from Source
0               0
1               -1
2               2
3               1

c.




Dijkstra’s Algorithm is one example of a single-source shortest.
it finds shortest path from source to all other vertices. 

Floyd Warshall Algorithm is an example of all-pairs shortest path algorithm,
meaning it computes the shortest path between all pair of nodes.

Bellman-ford algorithm can deal with the shortest path problem with negative weights.
Dijkstra Algorithm and Floyd-Warshall doesn't work in negative edges.

Time Complexities :

Time Complexity of Dijkstra’s Algorithm: O(E log V)
Time Complexity of Floyd Warshall: O(V3)
Time Complexity of  Bellman-ford :  O(V E)


Dijkstra Algorithm will be most efficent when a graph doesn't 
contain any negative edges.we can also computes the shortest path between all pair of nodes
using Dijkstra Algorithm in O(n^2) time which is better than Floyd Warshall. 
About negative edges we can only use Bellman-ford.
